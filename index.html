          <br>
          <p>My name is Donna England.  I am married with 3 adult children and 2 grandchildren. I graduated Windsor Forest High School in Savnnah, GA in 1986 at the age of 16. I then attended East Central Unitversity in Ada, Oklahoma where I completed my core undergraduate requirements.  I moved to Seattle, WA where I attended Shoreline Community College and earned my Associate of Science in Medical Technology in 1991. From there, I went back to Savannah, GA and earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Medical Technology in 1995.</p>

          <p>I met and married my husband in Savannah, GA.  After he left the Army, we relocated to North Carolina, where we have lived for the past 16 years. I have worked as a medical technologist for Carolinas Healthcare System for the past 16 years and have worked in healthcare for a total of 25+ years. In those 16 years, I have been a lead technologist in both the hospital and free standing ER settings. I have developed strong skills in QC / QA, troubleshooting and Performance Inprovement. I have written many technical procedures and have trained many employees. </p> 

          <p>In 2015, I obtained my Profession Science Masters in Health Informatics from UNC Charlotte.  I am currently enrolled in The Coding Boot Camp through UNC Charlotte continuing education. I am looking to change my career for something that is different and more challending. I would like to stay in healthcare but in a different capacity. I love to learn new things and will probably always be in some type of continuing education program.</p>

          <p>In my spare time, I like to read. I enjoy suspense and horror books. My husband and I like to travel.  We have been to many states along with two visits to Germany past few years. My husband and I are currently restoring a 1966 Ford Mustang.  I try to attend many activities with my adult children such as Wine and Design, Comic Con and Carolina Rebellion.  I am looking forward to spending more time with my grandchildren. </p>
